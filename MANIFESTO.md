# The world is broken. It's time to fix it!

## A Call for an Equal (R)Evolution!

Rising temperatures, oceans choked with plastic, headlines screaming about war, suffering, and injustice. We face mass extinction, crop failures, and the threat of nuclear war that could wipe out all life in an afternoon.

But what if a smart system is all it takes to turn things around? What if your knowledge of blockchains or your passion for peace negotiations could become a global superpower?

With computers and smartphones, humans can link together to propose, debate, and make decisions on the major issues that affect us all. **Equal Democracy (ED)** is the next evolutionary stage of democracy.

## Specialization is Key

What makes Equal Democracy unique? A single word: **Specialization**.

Until now, we've thought that a politician needs opinions on everything. Forget that. In Equal Democracy (ED), each citizen chooses **one single issue per year to specialize in**. The issue you are most passionate about.

Are you passionate about saving the oceans? Then you become part of the global decision-making group for marine environments. Do you burn with passion for education? Then that's where your voice will have a significant impact. This changes everything:

* **Real Influence:** Your vote becomes a thousand times stronger on the issue you care about most.
* **Informed Decisions:** Engaged citizens make decisions instead of elected politicians.
* **Manageable Workload:** Participating becomes easy, interesting, and quick.
* **Minority Protection:** Minorities gain immense influence in their core issues.
* **Higher Decision Pace:** Many parallel processes lead to a more efficient workflow.

## Global Problems Require a New Decision-Making Model

Climate and environmental issues, regulations for global trade, and the extent to which digital companies can intervene in our private lives are some of the questions that need new forms of decision-making. Democracy must adapt to the technology and problems of our time. With the help of technology, we can link all citizens together. Global decisions are not just an option, but a necessity to manage our existential issues.

Equal Democracy (ED) has no hierarchies or rulers. At the same time, we emphasize that representative democracy is not threatened. ED leaves national parliaments aside and concentrates on global decisions. The world has so far lacked a democratic tool to manage global issues, but now it will have one. The app will be free to download and will contain everything needed to change the rules of the game.

We want to establish a completely new, co-creative digital democracy through an app that will be translated into all languages. We want to present this proposal to the entire world and ask for help in translating and disseminating the document in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese (Mandarin), and Japanese.

### I. What is Equal Democracy?

Equal Democracy (ED) is an app and a method for global democracy made to give people greater influence and make the world more equitable.

ED aims to activate the world's citizens to establish what we call a **Global Citizens' Council (GCC)**, with the authority to enact global law.

The prerequisite for voting through this decision is the technology: ED creates an app for global democracy. The app will utilize existing, proven technologies like secure digital voting, open-source code, AI assistants, and advanced encryption.

ED is not just technology. We simultaneously embrace people's need to meet and discuss. Social community makes us more solidary and the world more democratic.

### The Advantages of Equal Democracy

* Direct and equal influence for all adult citizens.
* Provides a strong impact on issues we choose to engage in.
* All administration is handled digitally via computers.
* Transparency and fairness through secure digital technology.
* Benevolent AI makes it simple and user-friendly.
* Rewards democratic engagement.

### Resistance from Representative Democracy

Surprisingly, the internet has not already improved our democracy, but the current representative democracy (RD) has shown no interest in it. Representation is based on power being transferred from voters to elected officials. Ever since the Roman Empire, representation has been used to legitimize class divisions, and this function remains in politics.

The criticism is not directed at those in power but at the inherent divisions in RD. The physical confinement of a room is a natural barrier that maintains the division between voters and the elected, a barrier that digital democracy challenges. Historical development mocks all who try to escape elite rule, as Robert Michels argued. ED intends to prove him wrong. It is possible to eliminate positions of power.

### A Comparative Table

| Feature           | Representative Democracy (RD)          | Equal Democracy (ED)                     |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Power** | Concentrated with politicians        | Evenly distributed among the people      |
| **Decision Process** | Slow in physical environment         | Faster and direct via app                |
| **Transparency** | Closed with risk of corruption       | Transparent via blockchain               |
| **Perspective** | Limited and provincial               | Unlimited and global                     |
| **Citizen Choice** | Between people                       | Between issues of interest               |

### How Can ED Give People Greater Influence?

Here is a thought experiment illustrating how power distribution differs between Equal Democracy (ED), Direct Democracy (DD), and Representative Democracy (RD). Imagine a group of 10 people who need to make decisions on 10 different issues:

* In **Representative Democracy (RD)**, the people elect a representative (each with 10% of the vote). Nine of the voters then have no influence, while the elected representative receives a well-paid position and 100% of the power in all 10 issues.
* In **Direct Democracy (DD)**, everyone votes on all decisions. They have 10% of the power in each issue. It takes a long time to understand all the issues and their arguments, while the influence is small. No one gets paid.
* In **Equal Democracy (ED)**, everyone chooses one (1) issue they are interested in and knowledgeable about. They gain 100% of the power and can concentrate on this single issue. Additionally, they are paid in proportion to their contributions.

With ED, individuals thus gain greater influence in the issues they care about most. We believe this is what most people want.

### II. New Rights in Equal Democracy (ED)

The digital, app-based method makes participation easy – from submitting proposals to making decisions and evaluating the results. The app has two main workflows: from ideation to implementation, and from budget proposal to median budget. Both processes have several participation points. 

### **The Proposal Process:** To sort out, test, and evaluate the best proposals before implementation.
* Develop an idea and submit a proposal
* Choose an area of expertise
* Participate in a deliberation
* Rank an unlimited number of specific issues
* Debate and vote on one specific issue

  
### **Interactive Budget:** To determine the annual budget together.
* Participate in a live budget discussion
* Submit a budget proposal using the budget calculator
* Register interest in volunteering
* Invited to the local democracy party when the median budget is set

These yearly rights give everyone equal influence, while ensuring no one is overburdened.

### Reward System Increases Participation

The ED app has a reward system to increase engagement. The reward system is based on a cryptocurrency called **Pollar**, having the same value as USD. It can encourage activity, motivate volunteers, reward brilliant new ideas, etc.

Activities, like voting or participating in budget meetings, are rewarded equally for everyone. Those who contribute beyond that with programming, auditing, or serving as functionaries at local events receive additional piece-rate payments. The best reward goes to those who submit a proposal that solves a real problem. The proposal must then be voted through, implemented, and evaluated with positive results and no other negative side effects. Payouts occur in stages, and collaborators who improve the proposal also share in the profit.

Pollars require no banks or energy-consuming crypto mining; they function as proof of democratic work. The currency can be used by scanning QR codes with a smartphone. No one will become a billionaire, but everyone gets a little something. Over time, Pollars could develop into a democratically anchored global basic income. To hinder manipulation, extensive AI surveillance of currency flows is conducted to analyze deviations. The reward system is continuously calibrated to maximize utility and minimize the risk of manipulation.

### Anonymity

In the ED app, there are no identifiable individuals – only proposals, arguments, and judgements. Anonymity is used to counteract manipulation, surveillance, and coalition-building and to protect participants' privacy, allowing them to express their opinions freely. ED reduces the risk of public figures and celebrities gaining undue influence. The app is intended as an intellectual sanctuary where personalities do not influence us, but where rational arguments speak for themselves, and the strength of the ideas, not the people behind them, makes the difference. The system alerts if anonymous posts violate debate rules.

### Openness

The ability to counteract corruption is a distinguishing feature of digital democracy. Openness means that nothing (except personal identity) is hidden. Transparency ensures legitimate participation, enabling review and auditing. Everyone who participates can see and follow how good ideas are strengthened, selected, voted through, and implemented. Openness is uniquely enabled by existing technology.

### Global Referendum

The path to global equal democracy goes through a referendum. We want to establish a new political institution governed by the world's citizens via the ED app: a digital and transparent Global Citizens' Council (GCC) with the authority to enact global laws. For the referendum to be binding, a qualified majority must vote 'yes' to the GCC.

### Cooperation with the UN and NGOs

If ED votes to establish the Global Citizens' Council (GCC), it will become the second chamber in relation to the UN General Assembly. This people-controlled second chamber will, initially, accelerate the implementation of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

The Global Citizens' Council (GCC) supports all non-governmental organizations (NGOs) by giving their members more influence on their heart issues. World community organizations can act as executive bodies, but the GCC can also allow companies to offer solutions for decisions taken.

### Moral Responsibility at the Core

For Equal Democracy (ED) with anonymous participants to be accountable, a simple moral principle lies at its core. Globally, ED strives to reduce unnecessary suffering. It becomes natural to keep in mind when addressing various problems. As measures begin to take effect, the moral can be democratically changed, and thus, ED's fundamental principle can also adjust. In important internal decisions, such as moral changes, everyone has the right to vote.

Morality is limited solely to decisions made through ED. We come together as a collective to protect each other from suffering, and in return, the collective guarantees each individual's right to live their own life. Everyone is free to strive for personal happiness and harmony, and this integrity is respected. The individual may define what happiness is and seek their own well-being, provided that this pursuit does not harm others.

### Demarcation and Subsidiarity

Equal Democracy (ED) strictly follows the principle of subsidiarity. It states that decisions should be made at the lowest effective level. If they can be resolved at the regional or national level, they should be. ED aims to establish itself globally to resolve cross-border problems that affect people in multiple countries, such as cybercrime, human rights, or plastic pollution.

Sometimes, local and global interests can conflict. Morality then provides practical guidance: prioritize reducing suffering and problems affecting many people over those affecting a few.

### Equal Democracy at Lower Levels

The system is scalable, and experimenting at lower levels can demonstrate that ED works. Several experiments are underway. However, experiences from previous democratic experiments show that representative democracy (RD) is reluctant to give up its privileges and will likely oppose ED.

The reason we aim for a global referendum is threefold:

1.  The world as a whole lacks democracy.
2.  It is urgent to make decisions on several global issues.
3.  We can unite the world's people with IT and AI in a way that has not been possible before.

### III. Functions in the Equal Democracy (ED) App

The ED app provides users with a toolbox of democratic functions. Everyone has complete insight, but participation is limited. There are two main processes: the proposal process and the budget process.

#### Proposal Process

1.  **New Ideas** – Everyone can submit one political proposal per year in the app.
    The operational year begins with voluntary local gatherings to brainstorm and develop new ideas and proposals. Anyone can submit proposals in the ED app. Proposals that are new receive a QR code. For a proposal to proceed, 1,000 people must "like" it (scan the QR code) within 14 days.
2.  **Idea Development** – Co-creators help improve the proposal.
    Ideas that pass the first screening are reviewed and debated by a group of interested experts. They suggest improvements to ensure the proposal gains public trust. The group should be satisfied (consensus) before the proposal is presented publicly.
4.  **General Prioritization** – Proposals are compared, and the best ones advance to voting.
    Anyone can help prioritize which proposals within their chosen area of interest should advance to voting. A review takes place quarterly. Only the top-ranked fifth proceed to debate and voting. Proposals that narrowly missed the threshold get another chance.
5.  **Debate and Voting** – Everyone has the right to participate in one debate and one vote per year.
    Every quarter, it's time for decisions. Participants can then help decide an issue, but they can only vote on one issue per year. The ED app will contain a digital ballot box that preserves vote secrecy while allowing voters to verify that their vote has been registered.
6.  **Decision and Implementation** – Winning proposals are implemented on a trial basis by the proposed organization. Interested ED users monitor and ensure that proposals are carried out as planned and that the budget is used correctly.
7.  **Evaluation** – Did the proposal have the desired effect? After a trial period, it's time to measure the specified KPIs and see if the measures have been beneficial to the problem. This measurement forms the basis for the evaluation, which in turn determines if the proposal is permanently adopted.

#### Budget Process

A. **Budget Preparation**
Officials from the UN and the World Bank, along with interested economists from ED, develop a global budget proposal as a starting point. Together with last year's budget, these form the basis for discussion.

B. **Proposal Discussion**
Once a year, people will gather locally for in-person meetings to debate the budget based on needs and the proposal that will be put forward.

C. **Submit Your Own Proposal with Budget Calculator**
The ED app will have a built-in budget simulator, allowing everyone to submit a budget proposal. The median of all submitted proposals is adopted as next year's global budget.

D. **Internal Decisions**
In conjunction with the budget vote, important internal issues may arise that require a majority decision. This could involve changes to voting age, new features, adaptation of moral principles, AI assistance, etc. The purpose is to allow flexibility without risking hijackings.

E. **The Winning Budget is Presented**
The budget process concludes with the presentation of the winning budget proposal. In conjunction with this, ED encourages a global celebration to mark the new budget and the Global community. Immediately after the celebration, the next operational year begins with Idea development.

### IV. Some Questions

* **Can it be guaranteed that the outcome of a decision in ED will be good?**
    No. Nothing can be guaranteed. However, research shows that collective intelligence increases when many independent experts specialize in the same issue.

* **Will conflicts arise between global and local interests?**
    Yes, but these conflicts can be managed. The GCC will only take a stance on global issues, but these will also affect local conditions. Sometimes conflicts will involve choosing between reducing suffering and increasing happiness. Here, ED's morality states that we should prioritize suffering first.

* **Can bad decisions be appealed or stopped?**
    Yes. But first, the decision must be implemented and evaluated, with negative results. Then, the proposal can be reworked or completely withdrawn if a majority deems so.

* **Does ED solve all political problems?**
    No. ED accelerates the solution of many problems covered by morality (reduced suffering), but does not solve all of them. The system will gradually become better at solving problems, but no system can do everything.

* **Can ED replace representative democracy nationally?**
    Perhaps eventually. In relation to other historical upheavals, the shift from representative to equal democracy is possible. In practice, they can operate in parallel, like a bicameral parliament. On a global level, the GCC is introduced in parallel with the UN.

* **Can we be sure the GCC will not become corrupt?**
    The GCC will be governed solely through ED, which is designed to resist corruption. The program is open-source, and users are anonymous. If our monitoring AI detects suspicious activity, the system will be altered. We do not control communication outside the program, but we can flag influence campaigns.

* **How is ED governed?**
    ED is governed democratically, directly, and decentralised. There is no leadership, but instead a digital app that coordinates the network of global citizens. All decisions about changes to ED are made using the app.

### V. Why Equal Democracy (ED) is Needed

* **No Hierarchies:** ED has no traditional power hierarchies. Where a hierarchy enables centralized control, a distributed brain controls the body perfectly without being hierarchical. For humanity to govern the world in the Anthropocene, we aim to establish the Global Citizens' Council (GCC) as a digital brain, from which the world's collective citizens jointly steer the planet like brain neurons control the body. Electing the GCC is therefore ED's most important goal. Just as Confucius sought wisdom through consultation, ED is based on the idea that a combination of different intelligences leads to better collective decisions.

* **Secure Technology:** Technology is central. ED uses secure digital technology (smartphones, blockchain, AI) to overcome barriers of distance or language. Participants debate anonymously, rank arguments, and vote digitally – securely and transparently. ED uses cryptographic ID checks to ensure that all participants are real, unique individuals.
    * All users must confirm their identity so that each person has one (1) unique vote.
    * Voting is protected so that no one can cheat or see how anyone else has voted.
    * No one can impose a veto or otherwise hinder the course of democracy.
    * Everyone has the same share of power and influence.

* **Artificial Intelligence (ED-AI):** ED-AI acts as a personal assistant – a discreet, personal helper that makes the app easy to use. To make it easy for you to exercise your democratic rights, ED-AI reminds you, translates posts in real-time, checks spelling, compiles information, etc. ED-AI never interferes with our values; it only helps us express them if needed. Another function is system monitoring and protection against illegal activities.

* **The Distributed Network is a New Form of Democracy:** When decisions are made in digital spaces instead of physical ones, millions of people can participate and vote simultaneously. Digital networks are the prerequisite for creating ED. Decisions are made organically and threaded through a decentralized network. Specialization is more than just an extension or reform of liberal democracy. The interest-driven, distributed network as a form of decision-making suggests that a political evolution is imminent.

### VI. Why Should We Be Able to Make Global Decisions Together?

A fundamental democratic principle is that we should have the right to influence things that affect us. Global issues affect us. The greenhouse effect, microplastics, the threat of nuclear war, the right to education, the overfishing of the world's oceans, and global trade are issues that concern us all. We should be able to jointly make decisions on these simultaneous local and global pain points. Furthermore, everyone should have the right to freedom of choice and equality. With equality, there can be no superior political class or hierarchy. To achieve these rights, we need ED.

#### Equal Democracy is Needed Now for Future Generations

There are many reasons why ED is needed, but the most important is Global warming. Science has long sounded the alarm, but people avoid uncomfortable facts. The delay between cause and effect means that the effects of today's lifestyles will impact future generations.

This issue is existential for all of humanity, and therefore, it is justified to change the global political system. Gradual reforms are generally preferable, but in this case, reforms are too slow. The only rational approach is to use the internet to address the problem seriously.

The ED app contains a ballot box that can be used to conduct a global referendum. Given that there are already over 7 billion smartphones, and more than 66% have internet access, there is an opportunity. Earth's population is 8.2 billion, of which 70 percent are adults and eligible to vote.

50 percent of eligible voters is just under 3 billion. If three billion download the app and vote, with at least two billion voting yes, the GCC will be established, according to international legal practice. Impossible? Imagine a small snowball rolling down a mountain where the slope, snow depth, and temperature are perfect.

Imagine a small campaign that grows larger exponentially, eventually becoming unprecedented. It echoes in all media, from the smallest influencers to the biggest artists, engaging volunteers in every country who help people install the app and identify themselves. It is not impossible. Therefore, we must pull humanity up by the bootstraps, give it a brain so it can take responsibility for planet Earth. The question is not just political but existential:

**"Shall we, the citizens of the world, together form a transparent Global Citizens' Council (GCC), governed through Equal Democracy, with the power to enact global laws?"**

We stand at a historical juncture: either continue with our old, dysfunctional systems or create the new world order required for humanity's survival.

**Join the Peaceful (R)Evolution!**

It's time to act. Contact your best friends, family, and networks. Together, we can build the app and a future where every voice is heard and every person has the power to change the world. It's not a dream – it's ED. Now it's up to you.
